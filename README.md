## Linked List Theory, 203. Remove Linked List Elements, 59.Spiral Matrix II, Summary of Array.
May 11, 2023  4h

The third day for Linked List. Today we will learn about the linked list and its difference with arrays.\
The challenges today are about how to remove items from the linked list, create a new linked list, and the reversed linked list. Have fun!ðŸ˜€

## Linked List Theory
[Reading link](https://programmercarl.com/%E9%93%BE%E8%A1%A8%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80.html#%E5%8D%95%E9%93%BE%E8%A1%A8)\
A linked list is a linear structure connected by pointers. Each node is composed of two parts, one is the data field and the other is the pointer field (stores the pointer to the next node). The pointer field of the last node points to null (meaning null pointer).\
Arrays are contiguously distributed in memory, but linked lists are not contiguously distributed in memory. Each node in the linked list is connected by  the pointers.\
Create a linked list:

```python
# Here is a code block to create a linked list
class ListNode:
  def __init__(self, val, next=None):
    self.val = val
    self.next = next
```

## 203. Remove Linked List Elements
[Leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-linked-list-elements/)\
There are two conditions when remove an element from a linked list:
1. remove a middle node
2. remove the head node: head = head.next \
By creating a virtual head node **dummy head**, both of the two kind of nodes can be removed in the same way.\
To remove an element, find its last element, and change the last element's pointer points to the removed one's next element.\
Here deifine a <ins>current pointer</ins>, and **point to the dummy head**.

## 707. Design Linked List
[Leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-linked-list/)\
Can also use **dummy head** to solve this comprehensive question.\
We need to finish defining the following functions:
1. get the element in linked list at a given index 
2. add a new value before the head of a linked list
3. add a new value after the tail of a linked list
4. add a new node before the given index
5. delete the node at the given index. 

For question 1, firstly, define a <ins>current pointer</ins> for traverse. And **point to the real head** this time. The head of the linked list will be returned in the end. If there is no cur defined and use head for the traverse, the head will change and can't be used to return in the end of the operation.\
For question 2 add a new node, the order is very important. Create the right new pointer first, then create the left one. Like follows: \
> newnode.next = dummynode.next \
> dummynode.next = newnode

For question 3, current needs to traverse from the dummyhead to the last actual node. When current.next is null, it means the current has now points to the tail. Then let the current node point to the newnode.\
For question 4, to add a new node before the index n, must know the (n-1) node. So <ins>current node</ins> needs to traverse and be defined as the (n-1) node. Then follow the same order as question 2:
> newnode.next = cur.next \
> cur.next = newnode

For question 5, the same as For question 4, the current pointer needs to traversa from dummynode to the (n-1) node, and point to (n-1) node. So the node with index n will be current.next. Let current.next = current.next.next, then node n will be deleted.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
        
class MyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dummy_head = ListNode()
        self.size = 0

    def get(self, index: int) -> int:
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return -1
        
        current = self.dummy_head.next
        for i in range(index):
            current = current.next
            
        return current.val

    def addAtHead(self, val: int) -> None:
        self.dummy_head.next = ListNode(val, self.dummy_head.next)
        self.size += 1

    def addAtTail(self, val: int) -> None:
        current = self.dummy_head
        while current.next:
            current = current.next
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        self.size += 1

    def addAtIndex(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        if index < 0 or index > self.size:
            return
        
        current = self.dummy_head
        for i in range(index):
            current = current.next
        current.next = ListNode(val, current.next)
        self.size += 1

    def deleteAtIndex(self, index: int) -> None:
        if index < 0 or index >= self.size:
            return
        
        current = self.dummy_head
        for i in range(index):
            current = current.next
        current.next = current.next.next
        self.size -= 1
        
# Your MyLinkedList object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = MyLinkedList()
# param_1 = obj.get(index)
# obj.addAtHead(val)
# obj.addAtTail(val)
# obj.addAtIndex(index,val)
# obj.deleteAtIndex(index)
```
